# thalamus

This module is planned for routing, filtering, and relaying information between subsystems in Tatlock. The thalamus will help the agent coordinate and manage information flow between different brain regions.

## Planned Features

### Information Routing
- **Message Routing**: Direct information to appropriate brain regions
- **Priority Filtering**: Prioritize and filter incoming information
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute processing load across modules

### Coordination
- **Inter-Module Communication**: Facilitate communication between brain regions
- **State Management**: Track and manage system state across modules
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle conflicts between different modules

### Information Processing
- **Input Filtering**: Filter and preprocess incoming information
- **Output Coordination**: Coordinate responses from multiple modules
- **Context Switching**: Manage transitions between different contexts

## Integration Points

- **cortex**: Coordinate with the main decision-making center
- **hippocampus**: Route memory-related information
- **temporal**: Handle linguistic and auditory routing
- **parietal**: Manage spatial and sensory information flow
- **occipital**: Route visual information
- **amygdala**: Coordinate emotional context
- **cerebellum**: Manage procedural information

## Future Implementation

This module will be developed to enable Tatlock to efficiently coordinate information flow between different brain regions, ensuring smooth operation and optimal resource utilization across the entire system.
