# Thalamus

**Status: Planned for Future Development - Information Routing & Coordination**

The Thalamus module is planned for routing, filtering, and relaying information between subsystems in Tatlock. Named after the brain's thalamus responsible for sensory relay and information routing, this module will help the agent coordinate and manage information flow between different brain regions.

## Planned Features

- **Information Routing**: Direct information to appropriate brain regions
- **Priority Filtering**: Prioritize and filter incoming information
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute processing load across modules
- **State Management**: Track and manage system state across modules
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle conflicts between different modules

## Integration Points

- **Cortex**: Coordinate with the main decision-making center
- **Hippocampus**: Route memory-related information
- **Temporal**: Handle linguistic and auditory routing
- **Parietal**: Manage spatial and sensory information flow
- **Occipital**: Route visual information
- **Amygdala**: Coordinate emotional context
- **Cerebellum**: Manage procedural information
- **Stem**: Coordinate with core system utilities

## Development Phases

1. **Foundation**: Basic message routing and state tracking
2. **Intelligence**: Smart routing and load balancing
3. **Advanced Features**: Predictive routing and adaptive coordination
