# temporal

This module is planned for auditory processing, language, and time context in Tatlock. The temporal lobe will help the agent understand and process auditory information, language patterns, and temporal relationships.

## Planned Features

### Language Processing
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Deep language comprehension and analysis
- **Language Patterns**: Recognize and process linguistic patterns
- **Multilingual Support**: Handle multiple languages and translations

### Auditory Processing
- **Speech Recognition**: Process and understand spoken input
- **Audio Analysis**: Understand audio content and context
- **Voice Synthesis**: Generate natural-sounding speech responses

### Temporal Context
- **Time Understanding**: Process temporal relationships and sequences
- **Event Sequencing**: Understand chronological order of events
- **Temporal Memory**: Store and retrieve time-based information

## Integration Points

- **cortex**: Provide linguistic and temporal context for decision making
- **hippocampus**: Store language patterns and temporal memories
- **parietal**: Integrate temporal and spatial information
- **thalamus**: Route linguistic and auditory information

## Future Implementation

This module will be developed to enable Tatlock to better understand language, process auditory information, and maintain temporal context, making the agent more capable of natural language interactions and time-aware responses.
