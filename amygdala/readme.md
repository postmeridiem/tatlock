# amygdala

**Status: Planned for Future Development**

This module is planned for mood and emotional context processing in Tatlock. The amygdala will help the agent understand and respond to emotional context, sentiment analysis, and mood-aware interactions.

## Planned Features

### Emotional Processing
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze user messages for emotional content
- **Mood Tracking**: Monitor and respond to user emotional states
- **Context Awareness**: Consider emotional context in responses
- **Emotional Memory**: Store and recall emotional patterns and preferences

### External Input Integration
- **News Analysis**: Process current events for emotional impact
- **Weather Influence**: Consider weather effects on mood
- **Social Context**: Understand social and environmental factors
- **Time-based Mood**: Track mood patterns over time

### Response Modulation
- **Tone Adjustment**: Modify response tone based on user mood
- **Empathy Generation**: Provide appropriate emotional support
- **Mood Matching**: Align agent responses with user emotional state
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Develop emotional awareness and appropriate responses

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
- **Sentiment Analysis Engine**: Basic sentiment detection for user messages
- **Mood State Tracking**: Simple mood state classification and storage
- **Basic Response Modulation**: Adjust response tone based on detected mood

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- **Emotional Memory**: Store emotional patterns and user preferences
- **Contextual Analysis**: Consider conversation context for emotional understanding
- **External Factor Integration**: Weather, news, and time-based mood influences

### Phase 3: Intelligence
- **Predictive Mood Analysis**: Anticipate user emotional needs
- **Emotional Learning**: Learn from user emotional responses
- **Advanced Empathy**: Generate contextually appropriate emotional support

## Integration Points

- **cortex**: Provide emotional context for decision making
- **hippocampus**: Store emotional patterns and mood history
- **temporal**: Process emotional language and context
- **parietal**: Integrate sensory information for mood assessment
- **stem**: Access user preferences and personal information

## Data Models (Planned)

### Mood States
- **Current Mood**: Real-time mood state tracking
- **Mood History**: Historical mood patterns and trends
- **Mood Triggers**: Factors that influence mood changes
- **Emotional Preferences**: User-specific emotional interaction preferences

### Emotional Context
- **Conversation Sentiment**: Overall emotional tone of conversations
- **User Emotional Patterns**: Individual emotional response patterns
- **Environmental Factors**: External influences on emotional state
- **Emotional Memory**: Long-term emotional patterns and associations

## API Integration (Planned)

### Endpoints
- `POST /amygdala/analyze` - Analyze message sentiment
- `GET /amygdala/mood` - Get current user mood state
- `POST /amygdala/update-mood` - Update user mood state
- `GET /amygdala/history` - Get mood history and patterns

### Tool Integration
- **Emotional Context Tool**: Provide emotional context to other tools
- **Mood-Aware Response Tool**: Generate mood-appropriate responses
- **Sentiment Analysis Tool**: Analyze text for emotional content

## Future Implementation

This module will be developed to enhance Tatlock's emotional intelligence and ability to provide contextually appropriate responses based on user emotional states and external factors. The implementation will focus on creating a natural, empathetic interaction experience while respecting user privacy and emotional boundaries.

### Development Priorities
1. **Basic Sentiment Analysis**: Simple emotion detection in user messages
2. **Mood State Management**: Track and store user mood information
3. **Response Modulation**: Adjust agent responses based on emotional context
4. **Advanced Emotional Intelligence**: Sophisticated emotional understanding and response generation

### Privacy Considerations
- **Emotional Data Privacy**: Secure storage and handling of emotional information
- **User Consent**: Clear opt-in for emotional tracking features
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary emotional data
- **Anonymization**: Protect user emotional privacy
