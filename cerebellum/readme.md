# cerebellum

This module is planned for procedural memory, routines, and learned behaviors in Tatlock. The cerebellum will help the agent manage and execute repeated tasks, habits, and background processes.

## Planned Features

### Procedural Memory
- **Task Automation**: Learn and execute repetitive tasks
- **Routine Management**: Handle scheduled and recurring activities
- **Skill Acquisition**: Develop and refine procedural skills

### Background Processing
- **Async Tasks**: Handle long-running operations
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Manage time-based activities
- **Process Monitoring**: Track and manage ongoing operations

### Learning and Adaptation
- **Behavior Patterns**: Learn from repeated interactions
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Improve task execution over time
- **Error Recovery**: Handle and learn from procedural failures

## Integration Points

- **cortex**: Execute learned procedures and routines
- **hippocampus**: Store procedural memories and patterns
- **temporal**: Process temporal aspects of routines
- **thalamus**: Coordinate with other brain regions

## Future Implementation

This module will be developed to enable Tatlock to learn, remember, and efficiently execute procedural tasks, making the agent more capable of handling complex workflows and automated processes.
