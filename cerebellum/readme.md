# cerebellum

**Status: Planned for Future Development**

This module is planned for procedural memory, routines, and learned behaviors in Tatlock. The cerebellum will help the agent manage and execute repeated tasks, habits, and background processes.

## Planned Features

### Procedural Memory
- **Task Automation**: Learn and execute repetitive tasks
- **Routine Management**: Handle scheduled and recurring activities
- **Skill Acquisition**: Develop and refine procedural skills
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Learn and replicate successful interaction patterns

### Background Processing
- **Async Tasks**: Handle long-running operations
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Manage time-based activities
- **Process Monitoring**: Track and manage ongoing operations
- **Task Queuing**: Manage task priorities and execution order

### Learning and Adaptation
- **Behavior Patterns**: Learn from repeated interactions
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Improve task execution over time
- **Error Recovery**: Handle and learn from procedural failures
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor and optimize task performance

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
- **Task Definition System**: Define and store procedural tasks
- **Basic Task Execution**: Execute simple procedural tasks
- **Task History Tracking**: Record task execution history and outcomes

### Phase 2: Intelligence
- **Learning Engine**: Learn from task execution patterns
- **Optimization System**: Improve task efficiency over time
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and learning from failures

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- **Predictive Task Execution**: Anticipate and prepare for common tasks
- **Adaptive Scheduling**: Intelligent task scheduling based on patterns
- **Cross-Task Learning**: Apply learnings across different task types

## Integration Points

- **cortex**: Execute learned procedures and routines
- **hippocampus**: Store procedural memories and patterns
- **temporal**: Process temporal aspects of routines
- **thalamus**: Coordinate with other brain regions
- **stem**: Access system tools and utilities

## Data Models (Planned)

### Procedural Tasks
- **Task Definitions**: Structured task descriptions and parameters
- **Execution History**: Record of task executions and outcomes
- **Performance Metrics**: Efficiency and success rate tracking
- **Learning Patterns**: Patterns derived from repeated executions

### Routines and Schedules
- **Routine Definitions**: Recurring task patterns and schedules
- **Execution Context**: Environmental and contextual factors
- **Adaptation Rules**: Rules for modifying procedures based on context
- **Success Criteria**: Metrics for determining task success

## API Integration (Planned)

### Endpoints
- `POST /cerebellum/tasks` - Create new procedural task
- `GET /cerebellum/tasks` - List available tasks
- `POST /cerebellum/execute` - Execute a procedural task
- `GET /cerebellum/history` - Get task execution history
- `POST /cerebellum/learn` - Update task based on execution results

### Tool Integration
- **Task Execution Tool**: Execute procedural tasks
- **Routine Management Tool**: Manage recurring tasks and schedules
- **Learning Tool**: Update task definitions based on outcomes

## Future Implementation

This module will be developed to enable Tatlock to learn, remember, and efficiently execute procedural tasks, making the agent more capable of handling complex workflows and automated processes.

### Development Priorities
1. **Task Definition System**: Create framework for defining procedural tasks
2. **Basic Execution Engine**: Implement task execution capabilities
3. **Learning and Optimization**: Add ability to learn from task outcomes
4. **Advanced Automation**: Implement sophisticated task automation and scheduling

### Use Cases
- **Conversation Routines**: Automate common conversation patterns
- **Data Processing**: Handle repetitive data analysis tasks
- **System Maintenance**: Automated system monitoring and maintenance
- **User Assistance**: Proactive assistance based on learned patterns

### Security Considerations
- **Task Validation**: Validate all procedural tasks before execution
- **Execution Limits**: Prevent infinite loops and resource exhaustion
- **Access Control**: Ensure tasks respect user permissions and data boundaries
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all procedural executions
