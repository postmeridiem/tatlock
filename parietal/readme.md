### Spatial Reasoning
- **Spatial Awareness**: Understand spatial relationships and directions
- **Navigation Support**: Help with location-based queries and directions
- **Spatial Problem Solving**: Assist with spatial reasoning tasks
- **Geographic Context**: Understand geographic and location-based information

### Sensory Integration
- **Multi-Modal Processing**: Integrate information from multiple senses
- **Context Awareness**: Understand environmental and situational context
- **Sensory Memory**: Process and store sensory information
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Track and respond to environmental changes

### Environmental Monitoring
- **Home Sensors**: Process temperature, light, and other sensor data
- **Weather Integration**: Combine weather data with spatial context
- **Environmental Context**: Understand the agent's physical environment
- **Location Services**: Provide location-aware services and information

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
- **Location Services**: Basic location awareness and geographic data
- **Spatial Data Storage**: Store and manage spatial information
- **Basic Environmental Integration**: Simple environmental data processing

### Phase 2: Intelligence
- **Advanced Spatial Reasoning**: Complex spatial problem solving
- **Multi-Sensor Integration**: Combine data from multiple sensors
- **Contextual Awareness**: Understand environmental context

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- **Predictive Spatial Analysis**: Anticipate spatial needs and changes
- **Adaptive Environmental Response**: Respond to environmental changes
- **Spatial Learning**: Learn from spatial patterns and user preferences

## Integration Points

- **cortex**: Provide spatial and sensory context for decision making
- **hippocampus**: Store spatial memories and environmental data
- **occipital**: Integrate visual and spatial information
- **temporal**: Process spatial language and temporal-spatial relationships
- **stem**: Access location services and environmental data

## Data Models (Planned)

### Spatial Information
- **Location Data**: Geographic coordinates and location information
- **Spatial Relationships**: Relationships between locations and objects

- **Weather Context**: Weather information integrated with location
- **Environmental Patterns**: Patterns in environmental data
- **User Preferences**: User preferences for environmental conditions

## API Integration (Planned)

### Endpoints
- `GET /parietal/location` - Get current location information
- `POST /parietal/navigate` - Get navigation directions
- `GET /parietal/environment` - Get environmental data
- `POST /parietal/spatial-query` - Query spatial information
- `GET /parietal/context` - Get environmental context

### Tool Integration
- **Location Tool**: Provide location-based information and services
- **Navigation Tool**: Provide directions and navigation assistance
- **Environmental Tool**: Access and analyze environmental data
- **Spatial Reasoning Tool**: Perform spatial reasoning tasks

## Future Implementation

This module will be developed to enable Tatlock to understand spatial relationships, integrate sensory information, and provide context-aware responses based on environmental and spatial factors.
