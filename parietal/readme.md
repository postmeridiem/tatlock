# parietal

This module is planned for spatial reasoning, sensory integration, and context awareness in Tatlock. The parietal lobe will help the agent understand and process spatial and sensory information.

## Planned Features

### Spatial Reasoning
- **Spatial Awareness**: Understand spatial relationships and directions
- **Navigation Support**: Help with location-based queries and directions
- **Spatial Problem Solving**: Assist with spatial reasoning tasks

### Sensory Integration
- **Multi-Modal Processing**: Integrate information from multiple senses
- **Context Awareness**: Understand environmental and situational context
- **Sensory Memory**: Process and store sensory information

### Environmental Monitoring
- **Home Sensors**: Process temperature, light, and other sensor data
- **Weather Integration**: Combine weather data with spatial context
- **Environmental Context**: Understand the agent's physical environment

## Integration Points

- **cortex**: Provide spatial and sensory context for decision making
- **hippocampus**: Store spatial memories and environmental data
- **occipital**: Integrate visual and spatial information
- **temporal**: Process spatial language and temporal-spatial relationships

## Future Implementation

This module will be developed to enable Tatlock to understand spatial relationships, integrate sensory information, and provide context-aware responses based on environmental and spatial factors.
