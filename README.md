# Tatlock

**Status: Production Ready - Brain-Inspired Conversational AI Platform**

Tatlock is a modular, brain-inspired conversational AI platform with built-in authentication, security, and comprehensive user management. It provides a context-aware, tool-using agent with persistent memory, extensible skills, and a modern web interface with Material Design aesthetics. Designed as a privacy-minded solution for home automation, all models run locally and the datastore is on disk.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Linux**: Ubuntu/Debian-based system (apt), CentOS/RHEL/Fedora (yum), or Arch Linux (pacman)
- **macOS**: Intel or Apple Silicon (M1/M2) with Homebrew
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git
- Ollama (for local LLM inference)

### Installation
1. **Clone and Install**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/postmeridiem/tatlock.git
   cd tatlock
   chmod +x install_tatlock.sh
   ./install_tatlock.sh
   ```
   The installation script will handle system dependencies, Python packages, and the automatic setup of Ollama.

2. **Update API Keys**:
   ```bash
   # Edit .env and update the following variables:
   # OPENWEATHER_API_KEY - Get from https://openweathermap.org/api
   # GOOGLE_API_KEY - Get from https://console.cloud.google.com/
   # GOOGLE_CSE_ID - Get from https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/
   ```

4. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   ./wakeup.sh
   ```

5. **Access the Interface**:
   - **Login Page**: `http://localhost:8000/login`
   - **Admin Dashboard**: `http://localhost:8000/admin/dashboard`
   - **User Profile**: `http://localhost:8000/profile`
   - **Debug Console**: `http://localhost:8000/chat`
   - **API Documentation**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

   **Default Admin Credentials**: `admin` / `admin123` - CHANGE THESE

## üß† Brain-Inspired Architecture

Tatlock's architecture is inspired by the human brain, with each module representing a specific brain region:
