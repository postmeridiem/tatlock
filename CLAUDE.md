# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**IMPORTANT**: The `AGENTS.md` file contains the authoritative instruction set for all developers and LLMs working on this project. Please refer to `AGENTS.md` for:

- Complete project architecture and design patterns
- Development workflows and best practices
- Testing strategies and debugging techniques
- Module-specific implementation details
- Performance optimization guidelines
- Security considerations
- All other development guidance

Any conflicting guidance between this file and `AGENTS.md` should defer to `AGENTS.md`, which supersedes all other instruction files.

- Write clean, professional commit messages ONLY
